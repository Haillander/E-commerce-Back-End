# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

The objective of this project is to simulate the server side of an e-commerce application that sells goods. This is done by managing a database pull of products and product categories and id's, and having the functionality to edit said database with the use of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests.

### Installation 

Install the database using mySQL and then seed it using "node seeds/index.js". The .env file will need to be edited to your own credentials. Install npm packages and launch the server using nodemon or node server start.

### Usage 

[Demonstration of functionality using Insomnia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19yVk-W6NWW9g_-ZVN31XCBrLrgoX4LEn/view?usp=share_link)
